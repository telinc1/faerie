Faerie (name still pending) is the successor to old Super Mario World hacking utilities such as Tweaker and the CFG Editor. It's written in a relatively modular way which allows for future expansion.

The primary goal of Faerie (name still pending) is to edit sprite configuration files for [GIEPY](https://github.com/boldowa/GIEPY). It will also be usable to directly edit a Super Mario World ROM image, which is Tweaker's purpose.

Currently, Faerie (name still pending) is in very early development and it's barely functional.

## Project
Faerie (name still pending) is developed through IntelliJ IDEA (currently 2018.1 Community Edition) and built with Maven. Check the `.idea` directory and the `pom.xml` file in the repository if you are interested in contributing.
